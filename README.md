# Important Notes
- This mods depends on Geckolib
- The 1.20 release no longer supports worlds created with older versions. The file "biome3.json" has been removed, causing biome3 to revert to plains. This change does not affect the 1.19 releases, where this biome will continue to be supported (for now).

# ABOUT
This mod adds a new dimension called "Sculk Depths" to Minecraft.

To access this dimension, follow these steps:

1. Search for a deep dark biome with an ancient city.
2. Summon a Warden and let it kill a passive mob like a cow, sheep, or horse OR kill the warden.
3. this will drop Energy Essence which is used to craft an Energized Flint and Steel
4. Clear all the sculk veins from the middle of the reinforced deepslate in the center of the city.
5. Use the Energized Flint and Steel to light the portal.

When entering this dimension, it is recommended to bring a netherite pickaxe as the dimension is mostly made of a very hard block called Umbrusk.
