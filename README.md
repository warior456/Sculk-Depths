# Important Notes
- Upgrading from alpha to beta isn't recommended because of portal logic changes
- versions 0.0.9_b and earlier require Geckolib
- Quilt has been found to work with the right combination of fabric api and quilt loader but is not (yet) officially supported
- This mod is in alpha, we keep ourselves the right to make breaking changes (we will try to minimize damage where possible)
- Upgrading from 1.19 to 1.20 is unsupported and will break biomes!

# ABOUT
This mod adds a brand new dimension Sculk Depths, the name of this dimension was given by the player based on his first impressions.
However, the dimension contains so much more than just sculk, it has it's entire own ecosystem as if it's a whole new planet...
