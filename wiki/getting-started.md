# Getting Started
## Overview
1. Search for a deep dark biome with an ancient city.
2. Summon a Warden and let it kill a passive mob like a cow, sheep, or horse OR kill the warden.
3. this will drop Energy Essence which is used to craft an Energized Flint and Steel
4. Clear all the sculk veins from the middle of the reinforced deepslate in the center of the city.
5. Use the Energized Flint and Steel to light the portal.


## Finding an ancient city
Ancient cities can be found in the deep dark.
The easiest way to find a deep dark is to search for a big mountainrange on the surface and then carefully dig down.
## Obtaining energy essence and crafting an Energized Flint and Steel
Energy Essence can be obtained by killing the warden OR by sacrificing [certain mobs](sacrificable_mob_list).
The Energized Flint and Steel can then be crafted by combinding a normal Flint and Steel and Energy Essence in the crafting table.
## Lighting the portal
To light the portal you will need to carefully remove all the sculk veins from the portal, be carefull as this makes sound.
Afterwards you will need to right click the Energized Flint and Steel on the portal to light it, this consumes quite a bit of durability.

## Notes: 
- make sure to check the [Preparation guide](preparation_guide)


When entering this dimension, it is recommended to bring a netherite pickaxe because the planet is mostly made of a very hard block called Umbrusk.
