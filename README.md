# Important Notes
- versions 0.0.9_b and earlier require Geckolib
- Quilt has been found to work with the right combination of fabric api and quilt loader but is not (yet) officialy supported
- This mod is in alpha, we keep ourselves the right to make breaking changes (we will try to minimize damage where possible)
- Upgrading from 1.19 to 1.20 is unsupported and will break biomes!
