# ABOUT


This mod adds a new dimension the "Sculk Depths" <br>
To get to this dimension:
1) Search a deep dark biome with an ancient city
2) Summon and kill a warden for its new drop the Soul Heart
3) Go to the center of the city and clear all the sculk veins from the middle of the reinforced deepslate
4) Light the portal with the soul heart you just got from the Warden <br>
When going to this dimension take at least a diamond pickaxe because the world is mostly made up of a very hard block Umbrusk
